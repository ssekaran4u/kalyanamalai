                            <b>Is it possible for me to save my search criteria to avoid doing it every time?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">You can set and save your search criteria for your regular future searches. You can redefine your search criteria to introduce a new one and delete your saved criteria at any time. Always keep a broader search criterion for more result choices.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>What is the "Search Profiles" by the Reg.No or user ID or option?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">This is a more specific form of search. It is ideal for anyone who would like to narrow down the search details. If you know the registration number or user id of another profile you can use this option to view the profile.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>What is an advanced search?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">Advanced Search is very exhaustive and includes the entire important search criterion. It allows you to search across all the registered profiles. Almost all the time, this search brings out most conclusive results matching your expectations.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>What other search options are available?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">Members who look forward to find their partners in other caste or religion, or caste no bar category can filter and narrow their choices by using Intercaste search, inter religion search and caste no bar search options. Those who have a broader outlook to marry a widowed or divorced profile or the profiles under widowed or divorced category who are seeking similar profiles may choose remarriage search option. Search also can be narrowed to choose partners from special category who are physically challenged.</p>
                            <p class="card_p">In addition to all the above you can also search the profiles by using city, profession options or using their registration number if known to you.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>Why do I get ‘No matching records found’ during my search for the profiles?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">This may be due to your set search criteria. Please check whether the caste and sub-caste names are entered correctly. Also check the chosen year option to ascertain that you have not chosen a future year by mistake. Check the details and correct them before trying the search again.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>What is a keyword search and how it helps?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">Keyword search is the best option to narrow down your search by caste, profession, and other hobby details mentioned in their profile.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>Can a brother/sister who registers for his/her brother/sister use the same matrimonial ID for his/her search?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">A matrimony ID identifies each person uniquely and using of same ID will not bring the desired results. Please register separate profiles for you and your sibling.</p>

                            <br>
                            <b>How do I delete my profile?</b>
                            <p class="card_p">We hope that you are deleting the profile after achieving the purpose of registering it and successfully entered into a wedding life.</p>
                            <p class="card_p">A registered profile can be deleted by sending a mail to <a style="color: deepskyblue;" href="mailto:info@kmmatrimony.com">info@kmmatrimony.com</a> with name, registration ID details by mentioning the reason for such request.
